# React Project - Clicking Boxes

This is mainly a fun react project. The purpose of the project is to show 9 boxes to the user and let me select the boxes randomly. Whenever a box is selected then its background changes to green. Upon deselection the background again changes back to white. The fun begins when the user selects all the boxes one by one then the user is not allowed to select/unselect any boxes as the boxes automatically starts the deselection activity for each boxes the deselection happens in the opposite order or selection.
